# DataG_13022_superconducting_materials
These 13,022 superconducting materials are adapted from the SuperCon dataset after performing various data preprocessing steps.
If the Supercon dataset contains multiple transition temperatures for a particular compound, we calculated the average value (Tc_mean) for those compounds based on the mechanism described in the article.
